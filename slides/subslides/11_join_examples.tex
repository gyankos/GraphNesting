\begin{lucido}[Example (Conjunctive EquiJoin)]
	This is an example of a possible graph join query:


\begin{tcolorbox}[title=A Graph Join Query]
		Consider an on-line service such as \yellowemph{ResearchGate}
		where researchers can \textup{follow} each others' work, and a \yellowemph{citation graph}.
		\yellowemph{Return the paper graph} where \remark{a paper cites another one iff. the \greenemph{first
				author  of the first paper \textit{follows} the first author of} \greenemph{the second}}.
	\end{tcolorbox}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \yellowemph{Binary operator returning just one graph}.
		\item \greenemph{Vertex conditions are ($\theta$-)join conditions}.
		\item \remark{A way to combine the edges is determined}.
	\end{itemize}
