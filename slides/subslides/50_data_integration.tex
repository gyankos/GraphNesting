	\begin{sottolucido}
		Schema Oriented, uniform data representation:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item A schema can be always extracted if missing (generalization).
			\item Schema alignment allows to find data similarities.
			\item All the data source schemas shall be aligned to the final hub schema.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{sottolucido}

	\begin{sottolucido}
		Query Oriented (Local/Global as a view):
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The schema alignment can be represented as a query rewriting.
			
			\item We can perform each query separately on the original sources first and then integrate the intermediate results (LAV) or translate and align the data first and then perform the query (GAV).
			
			\item  In both scenarios, part of the query has to be performed on top of the intermediate representation.		
		\end{itemize}
