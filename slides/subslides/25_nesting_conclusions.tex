\begin{lucido}[Results]
\begin{itemize}
	\item This further benchmarks shows that all the current data model supporting nested representation do not support query plans allowing for a specific case of (graph) nesting.
	
	\item  The proposed approach extended the secondary memory's property graph representation by adding associations to nested vertices and edges.
	
	\item The serialized data structure provides a graph having an external containment data structure.	
	
	\item This data model achieves \alert{structural aggregation} for graph data, where aggregated data
	may preserve the original vertices and edges.
\end{itemize}

\begin{lucido}[Further Results]
\begin{description}
	\item[GROQ:] THoSP can be generalized into a more general algorithm.
	\item[Extending current graph query languages:] The sort-hash join technique allows to answer less-equal predicates.
	\item[Generalized Semistructured Model:] This data structure can be generalized into a broader data representation.
\end{description}
\end{lucido}

\begin{lucido}[Future Work]
\begin{description}
	\item[GROQ:] Further benchmarks have to be carried out over this more general general nesting algorithm.
	\item[General Nesting:] Provide a query plan where either grouping or GROQ are used.
